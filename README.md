## Rice-Disease-Classification-Challenge on Zindi

>  `Rice is a staple crop in Egypt, but despite Egyptâ€™s position as the top rice producer in Africa, 
  it still relies on imports to meet the demands of its population. One of the main causes of this gap in Egypt is rice blast disease, 
  which is responsible for 30% loss in rice production worldwide.`
